# Navi-Web Project

This project is a web application built with Vue 3 and Vite. It serves as a template to help you get started with modern web development using these technologies.

## Features

- **Vue 3**: A progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool and development server.
- **TypeScript**: Strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript.
- **ESLint**: A tool for identifying and fixing problems in JavaScript code.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

## Customize Configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vite.dev/config/).
